# python-challenge

For this cahllenge, I understood the basic logic but at times I had difficulty implementing what I was thinking. Therefore, for the PyBank part I asked AskBCS for help on how to start from the second line of the csv, skipping the header line, as I was getting an error because my code was pulling the string from the first line instead of the integer from the 2nd row. 

This was the hardest part of the challenge for me because it was much easier for me to iterate through the data after figuring that out.  In the PyBank part, I did an financial analysis of the budget data. I found the total profits and loss and then created a script to find the changes in profits and loss from month to month, resulting in finding the greatest increase and decrease from month to month in the profits and loss. 

In the PyPoll, part I sifted through the election data in order to find the number of candidates, how many votes each got, and what percentage of the total votes each candidate got. This allowed me to find the winner of the election who was Diana DeGette.
